The Pima Women Diabetes Prediction Project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in women of Pima Indian heritage over the age of 21. This application utilizes various machine learning techniques to analyze health-related data and provide insights.

## Technologies Used
- Python: The programming language used for development.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
- Streamlit: For building the web application interface.
- Keras: For training and building the deep learning model.

## Installation
**Download:** Download the app.py and requirements.txt files from this repository.
**Model Setup:** To set up the model ready-made, you can download the model.keras and scaler.pkl files. Alternatively, you can download the model.py and diabetes.csv files to set up the model yourself.
**Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files, and run:

> pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the App: Once the dependencies are installed, run the application using the following command in your terminal:

> streamlit run app.py
This will launch the application in your web browser.
